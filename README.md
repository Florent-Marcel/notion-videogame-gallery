## Setup

### API Keys

#### Steamgrid

https://www.steamgriddb.com/profile/preferences/api

#### IGDB

#### Youtube

#### Notion

### Deployment


For the deployment on your Linux machine, you will need both [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

To build the docker images, run 

```
docker-compose build
```

in the root directory.

After completing the setup, start our little magic tool with

```
docker-compose up -d
```

and watch in awe as ```./output/codes.txt``` fills with strings that look earily similar to raffle codes that work for Kellogg's Football raffles running from 08.03.21 to 07.09.21.


Stop the tool with

```
docker-compose down
```
